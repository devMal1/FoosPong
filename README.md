# FoosPong

> alpha: 0.0.2.3

## The game
FoosPong is a 2-D video game cross between foosball and Pong, developed using Unity.
The objective is to score more points than the opponent. This is accomplished by using your paddles
to defend your side's goal as well as hit the ball towards the opponent's goal.
The first team to score the number of goals equal to the max point is the victor.

## Controls
##### Keyboard
- *wasd*        >> moves the player's left paddle (set)
- *arrow keys*  >> moves the player's right paddle (set)
- *space*       >> resets/restarts the game

##### Controller (assuming PS4 controller)
- *left analog*  >> moves the player's left paddle (set)
- *right analog* >> moves the player's right paddle (set)
- *L1*           >> resets/restarts the game

## The build (setup)
Through Unity, the game is built as a windows application (.exe). _In its current
alpha build, it is recommended to check the *windowed* box to make it easier
to exit the game when finished playing._ Info and a link to the zipped file for
